# Chemical Database Generator

Enter a cas number (or a list of cas numbers). The code will make an API request to PubChems database and retrieve all necessary information for upload to Flinn database. 

Eventually, add a node js part that will parse through sds pdfs and retrieve most recent link (maybe better to just call pubchem for api then parse through sds, but might have more bugs tbd)
